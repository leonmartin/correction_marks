# A minimalist set of Correction Marks

There are four different types of correction marks:
* General Marks
* Line Marks
* Float Marks
* Other Marks

## General Marks

General marks are the most versatile mark type because they can be used to annotate one or more consecutive lines of text at once, or even floating elements like figures. Therefore, they are designed such that their pattern can be repeated in accordance to the length of the passage to be annotated. However, annotating very long passages this way can become cumbersome. For such cases, there is an alternative notation that leverages arrows to indicate the beginning and the end of an annotation block. The alternative notation should only be used when necessary since excessive use can negatively affect the legibility of your correction marks.

General marks are always entered on the left side of the text.

## Line Marks

In contrast to general marks, line marks are

## Float Marks

## Other Marks

# Modifiers

To allow for more flexibility, the blank marks described above can be tweaked using a set of modifiers. The modifiers of correction marks are always entered on the right of the modified annotation in superscript. Similar to the alternative notation of the general marks, they should be used only when necessary since excessive use can negatively affect the legibility of your correction marks.
