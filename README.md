# MinCorMa: Minimalist Correction Marks

This project provides a minimalist set of correction marks that can be used for marking theses, seminar papers, project reports, and other documents.

## Motivation

The idea for this project arose after my colleagues and I looked for a consistent but simple set of correction marks that we can use to mark textual submissions of our computer science students more consistently and efficiently. In our opinion, the sets and guidelines we found (including the [ISO 5776](https://www.iso.org/standard/61838.html)) had flaws in different regards. Some of them were too specific, some too generic, some of them featured too many or too few symbols, sometimes the symbols themselves were too complex, and sometimes the types of annotations did not fit our discipline. Hence, the goal of this project is to provide and incrementally refine a minimalist set of correction marks that can be used for marking textual documents.

## How

To make use of MinCorMa in academia, you simple have to adhere to the specification and usage guidelines of the correction marks provided [here](marks.md). For transparency, we recommend sharing the link to this project with your students. This way, they have direct reference to the meaning of your correction marks.
